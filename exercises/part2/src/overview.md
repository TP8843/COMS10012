# Overview

This page contains the exercises for Part 2 (the last 5 weeks) of COMS10012 Software Tools.

As with Part 1, each week contains two 'activities' -- sets of exercises which are supported
by videos to watch (linked from the main page for each activity). The exercises
within each activity will require you to do some work within your Alpine Linux
VM in Vagrant, which we'll be supporting in the labs.

Note that the 'Complete Application' material delivered in Week 23 is not
examinable, though it may be practically very useful to you in future projects.
