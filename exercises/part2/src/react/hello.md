# Hello World in React

In this exercise we will build a simple React app that greets the user, and so demonstrates managing state and passing it between components.

Create a react app folder with `npx create-react-app FOLDERNAME`. Edit the port if necessary, as described on the previous page.

You can start the development server (`npm start`) and it will automatically reload when it detects that you have edited a source file. This feature can be quite convenient to develop with.

## State and Components

We will create an app with three components:
  - The app component manages some state, namely a person's name.
  - The input component lets you enter and change your name.
  - The output compoment displays "Hello, NAME".
