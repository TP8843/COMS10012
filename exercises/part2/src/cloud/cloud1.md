# The Cloud

For this session, there are no videos. Instead, you should read the following
web resources, the content of which is examinable:

 - [What is Cloud Computing?](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-cloud-computing)
 - [What is Cloud Economics?](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/cloud-economics)
 - [As A Service](https://www.ibm.com/topics/iaas-paas-saas)


There are no exercises for the cloud material. Instead, use this time to
complete the React exercises, recap exercises from earlier in this part of the
unit, and ask questions about this or other material from across the unit. If
there are exercises that you could not solve or want to ask questions about, now
would be a good time to revisit them and ask for help.


_(The original intention was to include a non-examinable practical component
here using AWS services, but there was trouble getting this set up for the class
in time.  While not the same as a guided exercise, some of you may want to look
at AWS' own onboarding material
[here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/).)_
