# A complete application, part 1

In this workshop we will set up and inspect a complete application including database, Java back-end/API and React front-end.

Just one short video to introduce the topic:

| Video | Length | Slides |

Please try the steps on the "setting things up" page before you come to the workshop - ideally you will then be able to start the walkthrough in the workshop itself immediately, but if you get stuck in the set-up, you will be able to ask for help at the very start.
