# Attendance hurdle

This unit, like Mathematics A and B, has an attendance hurdle. You probably know the drill but here's the details:

  - There are 20 mandatory workshops, two each in weeks 13-17 and 19-23.
  - Week 18 is reading week so no workshops at all; week 24 is revision week so the workshops become drop-ins which are not mandatory and also do not count for attendance.
  - You are expected to attend at least 19 of the 20 mandatory workshops.
  - If you are unwell, you can self-certify your absence (e-mail coms-info if you need information on this), then the workshop counts as attended.
  - Workshops are Tuesdays 9am-11am and Thursdays 3pm-5pm. The drop-ins on Fridays 3pm-4pm are not mandatory and do not count towards attendance (they cannot be used to make up a missed workshop).
  - The hurdle is set at 15 out of 20 workshops. 
  
We recommend you attend in person if you can (and in-person workshops are taking place) as this is a better learning experience, but for attendance purposes, attending online counts exactly the same as in person. If you are self-isolating, or worried about catching covid, then attending online is your best option.

Since the expectation is 19 workshops, we will ignore any complaints if someone fails the hurdle with only 14 workshops but claims that's "almost 15", as it's not almost 19.

If for any reason we need to cancel a workshop, then we will give attendance for everyone involved. For example, if you attend 16 workshops, self-certify one as unwell, and we have to cancel two other workshops then we would count that as attending 16 + 1 + 2 = 19 out of 20 workshops, which meets the expectation. A workshop is only cancelled if we announce that officially on the unit page and on Teams.

For the in-person workshops, we may run sign-ins with a combination of paper sign-in sheets and scanning your UCard with a card reader, so please bring your UCard along - you should have it with you whenever you are on campus anyway, in case you are asked to identify yourself.

For the online workshops, to sign in you must have a working microphone and camera turned on and the TAs will often ask you a simple comprehension question which you must attempt to answer to get the sign-in. You do not need to get the answer right, but you do have to engage: just being in the Teams channel but not interacting with the TA at all does not count.

<h2>Strike action</h2>

In Week 16 (14-18 February) all week, and Monday-Tuesday Week 17, lecturers in the UCU union will be on strike. As a result:

<ul>
  <li>The workshops on both days in Week 16 and on Tuesday Week 17 are **cancelled**.</li>
  <li>The workshop on Thursday Week 17 becomes a drop-in. There is no new material, and attendance is not mandatory.</li>
  <li>All students get +4 attendance for the purpose of the attendance hurdle for free in Weeks 16 and 17.</li>
</ul>

This means that you do not need to turn up in Weeks 16/17 and will still get attendance for these sessions. No attendance will be taken in these weeks. This is more generous to students than simply cancelling the sessions and changing the hurdle to 12 out of 16 remaining workshops; if you attend (or are self-certified sick for) 11 of the remaining workshops then with the +4 you will still pass the hurdle.

There are also strikes on Monday-Wednesday Week 18, but that is reading week so no workshops were planned that week anyway.
