# Attendance hurdle

This unit, like Mathematics A and B, has an attendance hurdle. You probably know the drill but here's the details:

  - There are 20 mandatory workshops, two each in weeks 13-17 and 19-23.
  - Week 18 is reading week so no workshops at all; week 24 is revision week so the workshops become drop-ins which are not mandatory and also do not count for attendance.
  - You are expected to attend at least 19 of the 20 mandatory workshops.
  - If you are unwell, you can self-certify your absence (e-mail coms-info if you need information on this), then the workshop counts as attended.
  - Workshops are Tuesdays 9am-11am and Fridays 11am-1pm. The drop-ins on Fridays 4pm-5pm are not mandatory and do not count towards attendance (they cannot be used to make up a missed workshop).
  - The hurdle is set at 15 out of 20 workshops. 
  
Since the expectation is 19 workshops, we will ignore any complaints if someone fails the hurdle with only 14 workshops but claims that's "almost 15", as it's not almost 19.

If for any reason we need to cancel a workshop, then we will give attendance for everyone involved. For example, if you attend 16 workshops, self-certify one as unwell, and we have to cancel two other workshops then we would count that as attending 16 + 1 + 2 = 19 out of 20 workshops, which meets the expectation. A workshop is only cancelled if we announce that officially on the unit page and on Teams.

We will likely take attendance with Qwickly on Blackboard, but may use other
means if necessary, so do bring your U-card with you just in case.
