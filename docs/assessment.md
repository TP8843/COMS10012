# Assessment

This unit has an attendance hurdle: you must attend 75% of the mandatory workshops (all weeks except 16, 17 and 24).

Once you have passed the hurdle, your mark for the unit will be 100% from a final exam held online in the summer exam period.

# Exam information

## Timing

The exam for this unit will be a 3-hour exam starting at 9:45 am British time on Wednesday 26 May. The exam will be held online using blackboard and you will be able to find it on the day by going to blackboard, selecting the unit, and then selecting _Assessment, Submission and Feedback_ in the menu on the left.

On top of these three hours, there will be 30 minutes of buffer time so you should plan to submit your last answer at or shortly after 12:45, but the exam will remain open until 13:15. As you are already given half an hour of extra time, when the exam shuts at 13:15:00 exactly, no further answers will be accepted and requests for "just one minute more, I have a slow connection" will most likely be refused - you already have half an hour buffer for this. _This is a 3 hour exam with 30 minutes of buffer, not a 3-and-a-half hour exam._

If you have alternative exam arrangements that give you extra time, then the time you have will be displayed on the first screen after you start the exam. You should plan to submit half an hour before this time, as the time displayed is when blackboard locks you out. For example, if you get 10 minutes extra per hour, then blackboard should show 4 h 5 min time for you, of which 3 h 35 min are exam time and the extra 30 min are your buffer time, so you should aim to complete the exam in a bit over 3 and a half hours.

If you will be in a timezone that would make taking the exam in the morning difficult (e.g. America), and you have evidence of this (e.g. your home address) then you can apply to the school office to take the exam at a different time but you must do this for all exams, and by the end of April. You cannot turn up on the day and request a later time.

## In case of problems

In the (hopefully unlikely) event of a problem with the exam, e.g. a question not displaying correctly, blackboard or your internet connection going down, you should e-mail the school office using the `coms-info` address - not the unit staff. If you think there is a mistake in a question, also inform the office and then carry on with the exam - we will not provide clarification or other updates during the exam, as we cannot ensure that this would reach all students equally and in time.

If your internet connection disconnects but comes back, or your computer crashes and restarts, you should be able to enter the test again and continue where you left off: blackboard saves your progress (it is linked to your user account, not your HTTP session).

## Academic integrity

During the exam, and for at least one hour afterwards (to account for students with extra time), you must not read or write anything online relating to the exam where other students could access it. During the exam itself, you must not use any online resources that are not explicitly allowed, and you must not read or write in any chats, groups, social media, e-mail or any other forms of communication with other students for any reason whatsoever. Just posting a message in a student group during the exam, even if it's only "the exam is hard", counts as an offence under the exam regulations, and students on other cohorts have been convicted for this during the January exams. To be on the safe side, you should have phones off during the exam just like you would in an exam hall.

According to the official guidelines:

  - You must not collaborate or work with anyone else on your exam, either physically or virtually. 
  - The work submitted must be entirely your own.
  - We will view any instances of collusion as cheating and will take them very seriously.

## Allowed materials

You may use any handwritten or digital notes that you yourself have prepared before the exam, and you may use the PDFs of the slides. You may not visit the software tools website itself during the exam, nor any other online resources, and you must not use a POSIX terminal either.

You are allowed to use a calculator, but it is unlikely to be much use on this exam.

## Exam format

The exam will consist of 45 questions, of which the first 15 will be worth a single point each, and the next 30 will be worth two points each. One-point questions are mainly checking if you can recall a definition, two-point questions may require you to apply something you have learnt to a particular scenario. Different students will see different questions, sometimes they are randomised versions of the same question, sometimes genuinely different ones where every student gets tested on a different randomly chosen subset of a topic.

The three topics (1) POSIX and git; (2) databases; (3) web and cloud are all equally weighted on the unit, so there will be 5 1-point and 10 2-point questions on each of the three topics.

As a rough guide to time planning, if you reckon 2.5 minutes per point as an average, then you get through the 75 points that make up the exam in just under 3 h 10 min, which is a good target to aim for.

The exam not only tests what you know, but also whether you can reproduce this knowledge at a reasonable speed: the theory is that someone who has to google each question and then search for the answer in the results would end up running out of time (quite apart from being guilty of a disciplinary offence) whereas someone who knows the material should be able to breeze through the questions and complete all the exam on time.

You will see the questions one at a time, but you will be able to answer them in any order: there are _forward/back_ buttons on each page of the exam, and a bar you can fold out at the top called _Question Completion Status_ which shows a button per question so you can jump to questions directly. It also shows which questions you have answered yet, or not. Blackboard saves your answers whenever you navigate from one page to the next. When you are on the final question, a button called _Save and Submit_ will appear in the bottom right. Pressing this will end your exam and you only get one chance to do this, so make sure you don't press this before you're sure you've answered every question.

All exam questions will be automatically marked, but I will download and manually check the answers as well. Question types can include:

  - Multiple choice: you need to pick exactly one answer from a list.
  - Multiple answer: you are given a list of options and need to mark each one as true or false. There can be any number of true options, including none.
  - Type one or more values: you will be shown a question with some text/number boxes (HTML `<input>` fields) and instructions on how to complete them. You must follow these instructions exactly, as the automarker just does a string comparison - if I say "no spaces" and you put a space on the end, this counts as a mistake (and I will not give you the marks during the manual checking either).
  - Pick one or more values from dropdown boxes, for example to complete a command for a given task.

There will be no long answer or essay type questions.

## Revision materials

Anything that was in the slides/videos or the exercises may come up in the exam, except the details of how to use gdb in the debugging/build tools week. The exam questions lean more towards the exercises than the slides, so while you should revise both, a good revision strategy is to go through all the exercises again and think at each step: what have I learnt here? How might I apply this to different situations?
