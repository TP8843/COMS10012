# Unit Organisation

## Timetable

This unit runs in TB2 2021-22 (Spring 2022) along the same principles as
Mathematics A and B: there are two workshops a week and online materials to
support them, a mandatory [attendance hurdle](hurdle.md) and a final exam.

We have the computer lab MVB 2.11 booked for the workshops:

  - Tuesdays, 9am-11am
  - Fridays, 11am-1pm

This applies all weeks except Week 18 (reading week). In Week 24, we still have
the lab booked but there is no new material (revision week), we'll just hold a
drop-in.  

During these booked hours, you can ask anyone not taking this unit to leave the
room if you need a seat/computer.

The unit has a Teams page, to which you should already have access. Teams will
be the best place to ask questions about the unit and its content -- please
prefer this to emailing lecturers directly. If you ask on Teams then lecturers
can reply once and everyone can see the answer.

The unit has an in-person drop-in session scheduled 4-5pm on Fridays in MVB
1.11. This is not mandatory in the sense that it does not count for attendance,
and there is no set content. This session is a place for you to turn up and ask
questions, or to listen to other students' questions and answers to help you
understand the material. We may demonstrate or elaborate upon content from the
workshops, but there will be no assessed material presented only in these
sessions.

## Materials

The unit materials for [part 1](exercises/part1) and [part 2](exercises/part2)
are stable in the sense that there should be at most minor bug fixes.  The
schedule of workshops is as follows:

| Week | Tuesday | Friday |
|------|---------|----------|
| 13   | Posix 1 | Git  |
| 14   | Posix 2 | Posix 3  |
| 15   | Build Tools 1 | Build Tools 2 |
| 16   | Databases 1 | Databases 2 |
| 17   | Databases 3 | Databases 4 |
| _18_   | _Reading Week_ | _No Workshops_ |
| 19   | HTTP    | HTML5    |
| 20   | CSS     | CSS grid |
| 21   | JS      | Webscraping    |
| 22   | React | Cloud |
| 23   | Application 1 | Application 2  |
| 24   | _Revision Week_ | _no new material_ |

The unit is divided into two conceptual parts, separated from each other by the
reading week. Weeks 13-17 correspond to the [part 1 exercises](exercises/part1) which
primarily relate to the POSIX environment, software development tools, and databases. Weeks
19-23 cover the [part 2 exercises](exercises/part2), which introduce you to a
range of web technologies, before you are guided towards combining all you have
learned into a complete application.

The first page for each activity contains links to the videos, slides, or
readings for the activity that you are expected to watch or read before coming
to the workshop. In the workshop itself, you should focus on tackling the
exercises, though asking questions about the material is also fine. Some
workshop exercises involve group work where there is a good reason for it -- for
example, to practice working as a team with a git repository.

This unit is not driven by lectures that you are expected to memorise details
from, but by exercises which you carry out in the workshop sessions with our
support -- the videos are just one part of that support, to introduce the
concepts you'll be working with in the exercises.  If you want to do well on the
exam, we recommend you focus on engaging with the exercises and trying to get a
hands-on understanding of the many different tools and technologies this course
will survey.

One of the most common pieces of student feedback about recorded content is that
students would like videos or other materials out one week before they need to
be used in a lab. We will try and implement this as far as possible for this
unit: the materials for the first four labs are all available from the start of
term, we aim to keep all the content available in a similar timeframe, and each
video comes with its length listed in a table so you can plan when you are going
to watch them. 

This preparation also means the unit should be able to continue to run even if
national strike action or other disruptions affect teaching -- in this case you
might miss out on some support but you will still be able to continue working
independently.
