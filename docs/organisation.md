# Unit Organisation

## Timetable

This unit runs in TB2 2021-22 (Spring 2022) along the same principles as Mathematics A and B: there are two workshops a week and online materials to support them, a mandatory [attendance hurdle](hurdle.md) and a final exam.

We have the computer lab MVB 2.11 booked for the workshops:

  - Tuesdays, 9am-11am
  - Thursdays, 3pm-5pm

This applies all weeks except Week 18 (reading week). In Week 24, we still have the lab booked but there is no new material (revision week), we'll just hold a drop-in. 

During these booked hours, you can ask anyone not taking this unit to leave the room if you need a seat/computer.

The unit will have a Teams page, where we hold parallel online sessions for the workshops for anyone not in Bristol, self-isolating, or who does not want to come to the in-person ones. Teams will also be your place to ask questions about the unit - please do not e-mail me, if you ask on Teams then I can reply once and everyone can see the answer.

The unit will have an online drop-in session from 3-4pm on Fridays on Teams. This is not mandatory and does not count for attendance, but it is a place for you to turn up and ask questions, or to listen to other students' questions and answers to help you understand the material.

## Materials

The unit materials for [part 1](exercises/part1) and [part 2](exercises/part2) are stable in the sense that there should be at most minor bug fixes. The schedule of workshops is therefore:

| Week | Tuesday | Thursday |
|------|---------|----------|
| 13   | Posix 1 | Posix 2  |
| 14   | Posix 3 | Posix 4  |
| 15   | Build Tools 1 | Build Tools 2 |
| 16   | ~~Databases 1~~ | ~~Databases 2~~ |
| 17   | ~~Databases 3~~ | ~~Databases 4~~ |
| 18   | _Reading Week_ | _No Workshops_ |
| 19   | HTTP    | HTML5    |
| 20   | CSS     | CSS grid |
| 21   | JS      | React    |
| 22   | Application 1 | Application 2 |
| 23   | Cloud 1 | Cloud 2  |
| 24   | _Revision Week_ | _no new material_ |


These correspond to activities 1-10 on the [part 1 exercises](exercises/part1) page for weeks 13-17 and activities 1-10 on the [part 2 exercises](exercises/part2) page for weeks 19-23.

<p class="solidarity" style="color: DarkRed">
Due to strikes, the workshops on Week 16 (both) and Week 17 (Tuesday) are cancelled. The current plan is to cancel and not assess the databases section of the unit. Week 17 Thursday becomes an optional drop-in with no new material; all students get attendance for all four affected sessions for free for the purposes of the <a href="hurdle.html">attendance hurdle</a> on the unit.

The first page for each activity contains links to the videos, slides, or readings for the activity that you are expected to watch or read before coming to the workshop. Some workshop exercises involve group work where there is a good reason for it, for example to practice working as a team with a git repository.

One of the most common pieces of student feedback since the start of the pandemic was that students would like videos or other materials out one week before they need to be used in a lab. We will try and implement this as far as possible for this unit: the materials for part 1 are all available from the start of term, and each video comes with its length listed in a table so you can better plan when you are going to watch them. This preparation also means the unit should be able to continue to run even if staff and most TAs are unwell one week - in this case you might miss out on some support but you will still be able to continue working independently.

## Covid

At the time of writing (5 January) it is not clear yet what amount of in-person teaching will be possible this spring. Of course, even allowed teaching may be a problem if lecturers are unwell.

Currently the plans for this unit are:

  - **Plan A**: lectures online (videos) but two in-person workshops a week, which we can use for Q&A, showing relevant material live, and working on the exercises. If you are unable to be in Bristol or to attend in person, you can join a parallel online workshop on Teams but you will not get the same experience. Due to the nature of the workshops and to encourage students to ask questions without fear, _the workshops will not be recorded_.
  
    We will start the term with Plan A unless we are told otherwise, or unable to for some reason (e.g. illness).

  - **Plan B**: staff and TAs are online only so the workshops move online, but students can still use the lab during the booked hours if they want to. This includes students joining the online workshop from the lab (as the room is booked for us, no-one else can ask you to keep quiet on the lab so you can bring a microphone along and talk).

    We will implement Plan B if we are required to by university or government policy, if too many staff/TAs are unwell or self-isolating, or if there are other concerns for example non-compliance with mask rules.

  - **Plan C**: everything online, computer lab not available.

    We will only implement this if the university or government require it, for example a local lockdown in response to a covid outbreak at the university.

Currently, we hope that as long as the lab remains open, every student will be able to come in for both workshops each week. However we may need to introduce a rota where students can only come to some workshops in person if we are required to (for example new social distancing or room capacity rules) or if there are concerns about safety (for example non-compliance with mask wearing).
